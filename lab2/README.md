Solution for lab2 (past deadline)

The part that i don't get is that the optimal strategy should be to always zero the nim-sum (if it's not already),
but i noticed that when the number of rows with more than 1 element is one or zero, then this behaviour stops and
the optimal strategy became to try to obtain an even number of rows to 1 element
